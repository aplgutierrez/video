David Moyes is taking charge of his first match on his return to Manchester United after taking over from Sean Dyche, who was sacked last week. The Blues would be in the bottom three based on their form across the last 10 English Premier League games after winning just once and accumulating eight points.



Villa, meanwhile, have the chance to climb into the top seven this evening and close the gap to Man City and Manchester United, while fifth-placed Arsenal host Arsenal. After losing 3-0 to the Magpies on Boxing Day, Villa drew to Arsenal at home before beating Manchester United in the league and West Ham in the FA Cup on Sataurday night.
